"Ever since December 2019, this open-source project has become the "
"culmination of dedication and research towards figuring out the best way "
"to bring **interactions from Discord to you:** we are an easy, simple, "
"scalable and modular library for Discord interactions."

"Our library---inside and out, offers numerous benefits and presents "
"itself as a worthy module in your bot's dependencies:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:17
msgid "The base features of our library, built with our API include:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:19
msgid ""
"**Dynamic object data generation**: all event data dispatched from the "
"Gateway is dynamically transformed and generated into two-way "
"serializable JSON objects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:20
msgid ""
"**Sane rate limiting**: our HTTP client implements pre-emptive rate limit"
" avoidance, so your bot is guaranteed to never hit HTTP ``429``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:21
msgid ""
"**On-demand cache**: every HTTP request and Gateway event made is cached "
"when needed, so you never have to save information yourself."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:22
msgid ""
"**Simplified data models**: every object presented is accessible as "
"either a raw dictionary/``application/json`` or list of recursive "
"attributes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:24
msgid "Some more unique features that are exclusive to our interactions include:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:26
msgid ""
"**Event-triggered callbacks**: whether a component, application command "
"or interaction response, you'll never need to worry about bridging "
"responses."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:27
msgid ""
"**Dual-way decorator logic**: a decorator can act as both a constructor "
"for an interaction, as well as a callback."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:28
msgid ""
"**API-strict naming**: no more confusion with the naming approach of many"
" libraries; we follow the naming style of interactions from the "
"officially curated Discord Developers documentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:29
msgid ""
"**Extensive framework structure**: build your own tools and technologies "
